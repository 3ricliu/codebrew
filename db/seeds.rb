note5 = Note.create(user_id: 1, notebook_id: 3, title: "Talking to Ourselves", body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/aug/21/science-little-voice-head-hearing-voices-inner-speech\">\"Inner speech\" (the voice you hear inside your head when you're reading or thinking) is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx.</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>Most of us will be familiar with the experience of silently talking to ourselves in our head. Perhaps you’re at the supermarket and realise that you’ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. “Milk!” you might say to yourself. Or maybe you’ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you’re simulating – silently in your head – how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss’s voice responding.</p><p></p><p>This is the phenomenon that psychologists call “inner speech”, and they’ve been trying to study it pretty much since the dawn of psychology as a scientific discipline. In the 1930s, the Russian psychologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky\">Lev Vygotsky</a> argued that inner speech developed through the internalization of “external”, out-loud speech. If this is true, does inner speech use the same mechanisms in the brain as when we speak out loud?</p><h1></h1><h1>We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca's_area\">left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area)</a>, which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. Furthermore, disrupting the activity of this region using brain stimulation techniques can interrupt both “outer” and inner speech.</h1><p></p><p>So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing. One worry, though, is whether the inner speech we get people to do in experiments is the same as our everyday experience of inner speech. As you might imagine, it’s quite hard to study inner speech in a controlled, scientific manner, because it is an inherently private act.</p><p></p><p>Typically, studies have required participants to repeat sentences to themselves in their heads, or, sometimes, count the syllables in words presented on a computer screen. These lack both the spontaneity of typical inner experiences and the conversational quality (think of the conversation with your boss) and motivational purposes (“Milk!”) of inner speech. Although the experience is undoubtedly different for everyone (not everyone reports having “conversations” in their head, for example), what does seem clear is that inner speech is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Why does it matter whether we have an accurate understanding of what’s going on in our brains when we use inner speech?</p><p></p><p>One reason is that understanding typical inner experience may be the key to understanding more unusual inner experiences. For example, psychologists have argued that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/hearing-voices/#.U_SzYUix9FQ\">hearing voices</a> (“auditory verbal hallucinations”) might simply be a form of inner speech that has not been recognised as self-produced (although there are also important competing theories). Neuroscientists have found some evidence in favour of this theory. When they scanned the brains of people who reported hearing voices, they discovered that many of the same areas of the brain are active during both auditory hallucinations and inner speech. Broca’s area, for example, is often active in people when they’re hearing voices.</p><p></p><p>But if we really want to know what the <em>difference</em> between what happens in the brain during inner speech and voice hearing – and how inner speech might become hearing voices – then first we need to understand what our internal talk is usually like. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158212000125\">A recent study by researchers in Finland</a> attempted to address flaws in previous brain-imaging studies of inner speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they studied the difference between activity in the brain when participants experienced an auditory verbal hallucination, and when they deliberately imagined hearing the same voice. In this way, they controlled for aspects of the experience such as the sound and the content of the voice.</p><p></p><p>They found the main difference between the two conditions was the level of activation in a cortical region known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_motor_area\">supplementary motor area (SMA)</a>, which contributes to the control of movement. When participants heard voices, there was significantly less activation in the SMA, which fits with previous hypotheses suggesting that recognizing actions as one’s own might rely on signals from motor cortical areas reaching sensory areas of the brain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, none of this is to say that understanding what happens in the brain is the only, or the most important, aspect of research into hearing voices. We also need to understand what the experience is like, how we can help people who are distressed by it, and when there’s a need for psychiatric care. But to do any of this, we first need to know what typical inner speech is like, and the underlying neuroscience is part of that understanding.</p></blockquote>")

note7 = Note.create(user_id: 1, notebook_id: 3, title: "Why Dolphins are Deep Thinkers", body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science\">At a Marine Mammal Studies Institute, dolphins were trained to turn in trash that fell into the pools in exchange for fish.</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science\">One dolphin was smart enough to hide pieces of paper under a rock, tearing off smaller pieces from the paper in order to get more fish out of it.</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, Kelly the dolphin has built up quite a reputation. All the dolphins at the institute are trained to hold onto any litter that falls into their pools until they see a trainer, when they can trade the litter for fish. In this way, the dolphins help to keep their pools clean.<br></p><p>Kelly has taken this task one step further. When people drop paper into the water she hides it under a rock at the bottom of the pool. The next time a trainer passes, she goes down to the rock and tears off a piece of paper to give to the trainer. After a fish reward, she goes back down, tears off another piece of paper, gets another fish, and so on. This behaviour is interesting because it shows that Kelly has a sense of the future and delays gratification. She has realised that a big piece of paper gets the same reward as a small piece and so delivers only small pieces to keep the extra food coming. She has, in effect, trained the humans.<br></p><p>Her cunning has not stopped there. One day, when a gull flew into her pool, she grabbed it, waited for the trainers and then gave it to them. It was a large bird and so the trainers gave her lots of fish. This seemed to give Kelly a new idea. The next time she was fed, instead of eating the last fish, she took it to the bottom of the pool and hid it under the rock where she had been hiding the paper. When no trainers were present, she brought the fish to the surface and used it to lure the gulls, which she would catch to get even more fish. After mastering this lucrative strategy, she taught her calf, who taught other calves, and so gull-baiting has become a hot game among the dolphins.<br></p><p>\"Intelligence\" is a term with many definitions and interpretations. It's difficult enough to measure in humans let alone other animals. Large brains are traditionally associated with greater intelligence, and the brain of the adult bottlenose dolphin is about 25% heavier than the average adult human brain. Generally though, larger mammals tend to have larger brains, and so a more accurate estimate of brain power comes from the ratio of brain size to body size - the \"encephalisation quotient\" (EQ). While river dolphins have an EQ of 1.5, some dolphins have EQs that are more than double those of our closest relatives: gorillas have 1.76, chimpanzees 2.48, bottlenose dolphins 5.6. The bottlenose's EQ is surpassed only by a human's, which measures 7.4 (Australopithecines - hominids that lived around 4m years ago - fall within the dolphin range: 3.25-4.72). But we don't know enough about the workings of the brain to be sure of what these anatomical measurements truly represent. Today, most scientists share the view that it is behaviour, not structure, that must be the measure of intelligence within a species.</p><p>Dolphins have invented a range of feeding strategies that more than match the diversity of habitats in which they live. In an estuary off the coast of Brazil, tucuxi dolphins are regularly seen capturing fish by \"tail whacking\". They flick a fish up to 9 metres with their tail flukes and then pick the stunned prey from the water surface. Peale's dolphins in the Straits of Magellan off Patagonia forage in kelp beds, use the seaweed to disguise their approach and cut off the fishes' escape route. In Galveston Bay, Texas, certain female bottlenose dolphins and their young follow shrimp boats. The dolphins swim into the shrimp nets to take live fish and then wriggle out again - a skill requiring expertise to avoid entanglement in the fishing nets.<br></p><p>Dolphins can also use tools to solve problems. Scientists have observed a dolphin coaxing a reluctant moray eel out of its crevice by killing a scorpion fish and using its spiny body to poke at the eel. Off the western coast of Australia, bottlenose dolphins place sponges over their snouts, which protects them from the spines of stonefish and stingrays as they forage over shallow seabeds.</p><p><br>A dolphin's ability to invent novel behaviours was put to the test in a famous experiment by the renowned dolphin expert Karen Pryor. Two rough-toothed dolphins were rewarded whenever they came up with a new behaviour. It took just a few trials for both dolphins to realise what was required. A similar trial was set up with humans. The humans took about as long to realise what they were being trained to do as did the dolphins. For both the dolphins and the humans, there was a period of frustration (even anger, in the humans) before they \"caught on\". Once they figured it out, the humans expressed great relief, whereas the dolphins raced around the tank excitedly, displaying more and more novel behaviours.<br></p><p>Dolphins are quick learners. Calves stay with their mothers for several years, allowing the time and opportunity for extensive learning to take place, particularly through imitation. At a dolphinarium, a person standing by the pool's window noticed that a dolphin calf was watching him. When he released a puff of smoke from his cigarette, the dolphin immediately swam off to her mother, returned and released a mouthful of milk, causing a similar effect to the cigarette smoke. Another dolphin mimicked the scraping of the pool's observation window by a diver, even copying the sound of the air-demand valve of the scuba gear while releasing a stream of bubbles from his blowhole.<br></p><p>Many species live in complex societies. To fit in, young dolphins must learn about the conventions and rules of dolphin society, teamwork and who's who in the group. For these dolphins, play provides an ideal opportunity to learn about relationships in a relatively non-threatening way. At Sarasota Bay in Florida, Randall Wells and his team have observed groups of juvenile male bottlenose dolphins behaving like boisterous teenage boys. Using its head to do the lifting, one dolphin may even get another dolphin air borne, actually tossing it out of the water. It's unclear exactly what is going on. It could be play, but more likely these are serious interactions that are defining social relationships.<br></p><p>Dolphins gradually build up a network of relationships, ranging from the strong bond between a mother and calf, to casual \"friendships\" with other community members. Wells and his team were the first to notice that adult male bottlenose dolphins tend to hang out in pairs. The dolphins' motivation for ganging together is under study but may involve ecological and/or reproductive benefits. Dolphins may also form \"supergangs\". Richard Connor and his team in Shark Bay, Western Australia, discovered a group of 14 males. The supergang was a force to be reckoned with. In the three years it was studied, it never lost a fight.<br></p><p>To keep track of the many different relationships within a large social group, it helps to have an efficient communication system. Dolphins use a variety of clicks and whistles to keep in touch. Some species have a signature whistle, which, like a name, is a unique sound that allows other dolphins to identify it. Dolphins also communicate using touch and body postures. By human definition, there is currently no evidence that dolphins have a language. But we've barely begun to record all their sounds and body signals let alone try to decipher them. At Kewalo Basin Marine Laboratory in Hawaii, Lou Herman and his team set about testing a dolphin's ability to comprehend our language. They developed a sign language to communicate with the dolphins, and the results were remarkable. Not only do the dolphins understand the meaning of individual words, they also understand the significance of word order in a sentence. (One of their star dolphins, Akeakamai, has learned a vocabulary of more than 60 words and can understand more than 2,000 sentences.) Particularly impressive is the dolphins' relaxed attitude when new sentences are introduced. For example, the dolphins generally responded correctly to \"touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it\". This has the characteristics of true understanding, not rigid training.<br></p><p>Lou Herman and Adam Pack taught the dolphins two further signals. One they called \"repeat\" and the other \"different\", which called for a change from the current behaviour. The dolphins responded correctly. Another test of awareness comes from mirror experiments. Diana Reiss and her researchers installed mirrors inside New York Aquarium to test whether two bottlenose dolphins were self-aware enough to recognise their reflections. They placed markings in non-toxic black ink on various places of the dolphins' bodies. The dolphins swam to the mirror and exposed the black mark to check it out. They spent more time in front of the mirror after being marked than when they were not marked. The ability to recognise themselves in the mirror suggests self-awareness, a quality previously only seen in people and great apes.<br></p><p>Not only do dolphins recognise their mirror images, but they can also watch TV. Language-trained chimps only learned to respond appropriately to TV screens after a long period of training. In contrast, Lou Herman's dolphins responded appropriately the very first time they were exposed to television.<br></p><p>Of course, an understanding of TV is of little use in the wild, but the ability to respond to new situations has huge implications. In the shallows of Florida Bay, Laura Engleby and her team have recently discovered an ingenious fishing strategy. A number of the local dolphin groups seem to use a circle of mud to catch mullet. The action usually begins with one dolphin swimming off in a burst of speed. It then dives below the surface, circling a shoal of fish, stirring up mud along the way. On cue, the other dolphins in the group move into position, forming a barrier to block off any underwater escape routes. As the circle of mud rises to the surface, the mullet are trapped. Their only option is to leap clear out of the water and unwittingly straight into the open mouths of the waiting dolphins.<br></p><p>There is still much to learn about these flexible problem-solvers, but from the evidence so far, it seems that dolphins do indeed deserve their reputation for being highly intelligent.</p></blockquote>" )

He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what <em>The New Yorker</em> described as \"the force and variety of his swearing\" when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as \"the <em>Colonel's</em> chicken\". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that \"it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy\" but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him denounced it to the franchisee as \"God-damned slop\" or pushed it onto the floor. In 1973, Sanders sued <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heublein_Inc.\" title=\"Heublein Inc.\">Heublein Inc.</a>—the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken—over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as \"wallpaper paste\" to which \"sludge\" was added.</p><p></p><p>Sanders and his wife reopened their Shelbyville restaurant as \"Claudia Sanders, The Colonel's Lady\" and served KFC-style chicken there as part of a full-service dinner menu, and talked about expanding the restaurant into a chain. He was sued by the company for it.</p><p></p><p>After reaching a settlement with Heublein, he sold the Colonel's Lady restaurant, and it has continued to operate since then (currently as the \"Claudia Sanders Dinner House\"). It serves his \"original recipe\" fried chicken as part of its (non-fast-food) dinner menu, and it is the only non-KFC restaurant that serves an authorized version of the fried chicken recipe.</p><p></p><p>Sanders later used his stock holdings to create the Colonel Harland Sanders Trust and Colonel Harland Sanders Charitable Organization, which used the proceeds to aid charities and fund scholarships. His trusts continue to donate money to groups like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trillium_Health_Care_Centre\" title=\"Trillium Health Care Centre\">Trillium Health Care Centre</a>; a wing of their building specializes in women's and children's care and has been named after him.

It has been the pinnacle of motoring for the last six years. Many facts have famously been splashed around about the Veyron, things like “At 250 mph, the Veyron’s tires will last fifteen minutes. Its 26.4-gallon fuel tank goes dry in twelve.” And “At the Veyron’s 253-mph top speed, the Veyron consumes 47,000 litres of air per minute — as much air as one man breathes in four days.”</p><p></p><p>You can pick these 95 RON facts up on some repeat on Dave but here are some Ultimate Unleaded 102 RON pub ammo facts about the Bugatti Veyron.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 1: </strong>The waste energy from running the 16.4 litre engine at full whack could heat 10 family homes in the winter.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 2: </strong>It takes 15 hours to build one radiator for the Veyron – each car has a total of 10.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 3: </strong>The brakes can withstand heat of up to 1800°C</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 4: </strong>When the air brake is at an angle of 55 degrees it generates 70% of the braking force of an average car.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 5: </strong>The Bugatti Veyron is split into three parts and only held together with 14 bolts.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 6: </strong>The Veyron uses special Michelin PAX tires found on no other car. The rear wheels are 14.5 inches wide, twice as wide as a normal car. If you require replacements the car needs to be shipped to France, a process that costs $70,000.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 7: </strong>It takes 8 days to weld a Bugatti Veyron fuel tank.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 8: </strong>In a Veyron it is quicker to decelerate from 60mph to 0 than it is to accelerate there. (It only takes 2.8 seconds to get to 60)</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 9: </strong>Once being road tested for 500 kilometres, each car is put in a light tunnel and inspected and polished for two days solid.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 10: </strong>A Bugatti Veyron uses fuel pumps that can pump fuel eight times faster than a normal car.</p></blockquote>")

The website looks identical to BestBuy.com…except for the prices.</p><p></p><p>The secret website was first revealed by George Gombossy of the Hartford Courant (Way to go, George!). While investigating a tip from a reader, George was shown the internal website. It was identical to BestBuy.com, but showed a higher price for the item he was interested in. George was mislead by Best Buy employees to believe it was the “real” BestBuy.com. Eventually he found some Best Buy employees who admitted to the site’s existence and even showed him how it worked.</p><p></p><p>Now, after initially denying the site existed, Best Buy is cooperating with the investigation. From George’s column:</p><blockquote><p><em>Company spokesman Justin Barber, who in early February denied the existence of the internal website that could be accessed only by employees, says his company is “cooperating fully” with the state attorney general’s investigation.</em></p><p><em>Barber insists that the company never intended to mislead customers.</em></p><p><em>State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered the investigation into Best Buy’s practices on Feb. 9 after my column disclosed the website and showed how employees at two Connecticut stores used it to deny customers a $150 discount on a computer advertised on BestBuy.com.</em></p><p><em>Blumenthal said Wednesday that Best Buy has also confirmed to his office the existence of the intranet site, but has so far failed to give clear answers about its purpose and use.</em></p><p><em>“Their responses seem to raise as many questions as they answer,” Blumenthal said in a telephone interview. “Their answers are less than crystal clear.”</em></p></blockquote><p>There was a lot of speculation as to whether this “secret intranet” was real or not.
