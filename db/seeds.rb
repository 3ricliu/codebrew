That was until 15 years ago, when Alaska converted a World War II rail tunnel to handle cars, too.</p><p></p><p>The drive through the single-lane tunnel can feel suffocating, but it's liberating for Whittier's residents, who arrange their lives by the tunnel's timetable -- cars can only cross once an hour in either direction, and if you're trying to get back to town after 10:30 p.m., you're out of luck.</p><p></p><p>A common sight at the entrance to Whittier is of people who missed the last crossing sleeping in their cars. Many residents own T-shirts that say \"POW.\" Prisoner of Whittier, that is.</p><p></p><p>The thing is, Whittierites never have to take the tunnel if they don't want to, even though the tiny southwest Alaska town is severed from the outside world in so many ways. It snows 22 feet a year here, more than 1,000 times the normal national average (OK, Boston this past winter doesn't count).</p><p></p><p>Residents don't even have to leave the building they live in if they don't want to.</p><p>That's because Whittier, including its hospital, school and city government, functions within one self-sufficient structure: a Cold War behemoth that seems better suited to a city like Newark (no offense to Jersey).</p><p></p><p>The 14-story Begich Towers Incorporated, known around these parts simply as BTI, is probably the last thing you'd expect to see in an outpost as remote as this.</p><p></p><p>It soars skyward, rudely interrupting the surrounding National Geographic landscape of glaciers and Prince William Sound. BTI withstands six months of rain every year, followed by six months of snow and howling 80 mph winds.

It means that even when it's freezing, city employees like Jennifer Rogers can go to work in sandals that show off her red-lacquered nails.

Most of them have homes in the tower, as though they were occupying separate bedrooms in one huge house. About their isolation together, they say: \"We're all family here.\"</p><p></p><p>One big family. With lots of love and, some say, equal parts dysfunction.

As executive director of the Washington State Potato Commission, Voigt has pledged to eat nothing but potatoes for two months.</p><p>No toppings. No sides. Just the wholesome goodness of 20 potatoes a day to meet his caloric needs, from Oct. 1 to Nov. 29.</p><p>\"I want to show the world that the potato is so healthy that you could live off them alone for an extended period of time without any negative impact to your health,\" Voigt explained on his website.</p><p></p><p></p><p>You don't get that kind of commitment from the scallion commissioner, that no-good lackey. But to paraphrase the announcer before any Evel Knievel stunt, \"Kids, don't try this at home.\"</p><p></p><p>Much research has been conducted on potatoes, and the conclusion drawn by every medical doctor and nutritionist on the planet is that you have to be nuts to think you can live off of potatoes.</p><p></p><p>To Voigt's credit, his lighthearted stunt will educate the public about many healthy aspects of the potato: a decent and inexpensive source of vitamin C, vitamin B6, potassium, magnesium and, with the skin left on, dietary fiber.</p><p></p><p>Also, low-carb advocates are harsher on the potato than science allows them to be. Some potato varieties, prepared correctly, can be as healthy as the much-lauded whole grains.</p><p></p><p>Voigt didn't enter this diet blindly. He told LiveScience he first consulted with a doctor and dietician to confirm he could go 60 days on just potatoes. You need healthy kidneys to process the excess potassium delivered by 20 potatoes a day. You also need a store of nutrients potatoes lack, such as vitamin A for proper vision, or else <em>exit</em> this diet blindly.</p><p></p><p>The potato's charm is its mediocrity: It is a decent famine food, because it has modest amounts of many nutrients, as opposed to the so-called healthy orange, which just delivers vitamin C and some fiber. The United Nations has promoted the potato as a means to eliminate world hunger.</p><p></p><p>The problem is that potatoes have a high glycemic index, a measure of how quickly carbohydrates are absorbed into the bloodstream. Foods with a higher glycemic index — most notoriously, processed foods — are associated with weight gain, insulin resistance and diabetes.</p><p></p><p>Potatoes get worse with the typical preparation: mashed and served with butter or gravy, or fried and salted.</p><p>\"Potatoes can be an excellent part of a healthy diet, but are not a healthy single source diet,\" said Barry Swanson, regents professor and interim director of the School of Food Science at Washington State University and University of Idaho, a guy who traverses the two states that produce about half of North America's potatoes. \"The glucose release in the body is pretty large for most potato products since the starch is readily digestible.\"</p><p></p><p>This means the potato initially satisfies energy needs but, if that's your primary food source, leaves you hungry and tired a few hours later, Swanson said. Like all starches, the potato is most healthful when eaten with other vegetables.</p><p></p><p>A baked Russet has a glycemic index of 76. Most starches have a lower glycemic index, such as white rice (64), brown rice (55), lentils and beans (under 30) and barley (25), according to the Linus Pauling Institute at Oregon State University. Vinegar and cold storage lowers the glycemic index. A cold, boiled red potato has a glycemic index of 55.</p><p></p><p>For the record, Voigt told LiveScience his blood sugar level is in the mid-90s, slightly high but within normal range and actually lower than his pre-diet measurement.</p><p></p><p>Can humans survive on any single food? A whale or other marine mammal might do the trick. Some Inuit have survived long periods entirely on meat, attaining vitamin C in muktuk, the skin and blubber of whales.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, potatoes offer a complete protein if you eat enough, over 10 per day. But you would ultimately encounter deficiencies in vitamins A, B12 and E, and calcium and selenium if you keep to just potatoes. Potatoes are slightly toxic, too. The poison is in the stem and leaves, but trace amounts can be in greenish spots on the potato itself and can cause serious illness if you eat enough.</p><p></p><p>In eating any single vegetable, you are sacrificing nutrients. Soybeans, chickpeas, lentils, or carrots also provide a good range of nutrients. Subjective, yes. I welcome your suggestions.</p>")

Why does it matter?</p><p></p><p>You're most likely to have some sort of accident during takeoff and landing. This is also why your tray tables have to be up and you can't have laptops during these times: ease of evacuation. If your seat is back, and something happens and the plane needs to be evacuated quickly, you just made it harder for the person behind you to get out.</p><p></p><p>All the seats are tested for a very specific set of conditions, including seat up and table in the upright position. The seats pass or fail based on how much bodily damage they do, so adding more things that increase bodily damage, such as being farther away from hitting the seat in front of you or having a tray table down or a bag in your lap, cause you to make the test conditions not applicable anymore and cause a dramatic decrease in the survivability of a crash situation.</p><p></p><p>And yes, the test conditions are only applicable in the times of flight that are most likely to crash, taxi, takeoff, turbulence and landing. In those situations, you prepare for crash situations by removing all items blocking emergency exit, put your seat in the tested position and fasten your seatbelt.</p><p></p><p>The reason passengers are asked to put their seats upright or in the TTOL (Taxi, Take Off and Landing) position is because the seat has been engineered, tested (dynamic and static) and certified in this position and only in this position. TTOL is the most structurally sound position the seat can offer in the advent of an emergency. A few degrees off of the TTOL position can greatly affect effectiveness of seat safety devices.</p>")

Some food, like garlic and onion, have special little pieces that don't lose their flavor after they are broken up and put in your blood, so when the blood takes them from your stomach to your lungs, you taste them again when you breathe out. </p><p></p><p>Also, these same pieces can be sucked up by your skin. To try this out, if you put some cut up garlic in between your toes, you can taste it after a little while.</p><p></p><p>There is a compound in garlic called allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). </p><p></p><p>It is a gas which gets absorbed into the blood when you are digesting the garlic (and onions and shallots). </p><p></p><p>From the blood it is transferred to the lungs where it is then exhaled.

And the search would return all images that are identical when resized to that format, which means they have a similar average color in each of the 9 parts that are sized down to 1 pixel.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Google searches the internet all the time and stores their findings in a huge database (this is called \"indexing\"). </p><p></p><p>They stumble onto a lot of different images that way. Every time they find a picture, they take as much data as they can from that image and store it. One of these bits of data is the file's \"checksum\". That's when you take a file and add all the bits and bytes that make up the file together according to a specific calculation - usually a so-called \"hash function\", which is more or less unique for that particular file. </p><p></p><p>The amount of possible permutations is enormous - we're talking about sextillions or septillions of different images before you're likely to find a reoccurring checksum (a so-called \"collision\").</p><p></p><p>Now, say that you want to know the origin of a certain picture. You upload the image and Google calculates the file's checksum. This checksum is then compared to the checksums google already has in their databases, and any hits are shown in your browser. The downside of this method is that if an image is altered even slightly, it's checksum will be vastly different. So, cropping or resizing would make a picture \"unique\" again in this respect. </p><p></p><p>That's why Google came up with other aspects of pictures to index as well - colors, hue, saturation and EXIF-data (the metadata stored with digital photographs) are indexed as well, as is the context in which a picture is placed on a website - this may help personalize the results to some extent.</p><p></p><p>All of these combined form a scorecard, and the most likely \"hits\" are shown.

What causes nostalgia?</p><p></p><p>The Hippocampus in our Limbic system might be the answer as it is a part of a series of processes which take in short term memory, transfer those memories to long term, and is connected to the amygadala - who is known for processing emotions and levels of fear. </p><p></p><p>The temporal lobe is known for keeping information which can help with retrieval.</p><p></p><p>So, you have several small people working inside your head while you're awake or sleeping. These people all have different jobs; some work to make sure we're safe, some work to make sure things make sense, some have personalities, while others are aspects of our emotions. Two of these people have an important jobs. </p><p></p><p>One is a logistician - a person who takes information from what other people tell him, and he decides if it is important enough to keep (his name is hip). The other is a man who is completely emotional, and takes note of how we feel at a given moment (His name is amy). Amy and Hip go way back, and their friendship shares a deep connection. </p><p></p><p>So, when Amy senses something about the world, he sends a message to Hip. Hip has received a few other messages, but what is important is that Hip wants to file the good and bad memories so that we're safe and we have identifiers to those situations. Amy helps Hip store files that they both consider important into his shared folder, and Hips other friends (such as the guys who see, feel, etc) who have been sending him messages get tagged in the file as well. </p><p></p><p>That file is now in your history, with all their relevant friends tagged, and all the important aspects covered. When you experience a moment that is similar to one of those events on file, Amy and Hip call one of their friends who has the memory (we'll call him temporal, but some other friends do a similar job as him). They all open it, and they get to have a small recollection of what made that event so special.</p><p></p><p>Memories and Emotions are tied together very strongly, and for some people, it is not a good thing. When Amy gets hurt, Hip and Amys other friends aren't happy. Amy begins to bring up dramatic experiences, such as war, famine, disease, death and begins to over-react when things cause Hip and his friends to bring up any 'triggers'. </p><p></p><p>This is PTSD - a dramatic and potent case of memory retrieval. Similarly, people who are depressed have many of their mental people tired or over-worked. It is commonly not that persons fault, and can happen because of miscommunications that happen when they talk.</p><p></p><p>Memories and Emotions can be good though, like with just the right amount of nostalgia. If the brainiacs in your head are working together, then they sometimes bring up memories of fun times. Times when you were relaxed. You were listening to music, playing a game, talking with one of your friends... almost anything can be nostalgic if the context is right. </p><p></p><p>Once you're comfortable, the team works together to store that information so that you know what it is like, and have a reference point in the future.</p>")

Perhaps you’re at the supermarket and realise that you’ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. “Milk!” you might say to yourself. Or maybe you’ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you’re simulating – silently in your head – how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss’s voice responding.</p><p></p><p>This is the phenomenon that psychologists call “inner speech”, and they’ve been trying to study it pretty much since the dawn of psychology as a scientific discipline. In the 1930s, the Russian psychologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev_Vygotsky\">Lev Vygotsky</a> argued that inner speech developed through the internalization of “external”, out-loud speech. If this is true, does inner speech use the same mechanisms in the brain as when we speak out loud?</p><h1></h1><h1>We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broca's_area\">left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca’s area)</a>, which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. Furthermore, disrupting the activity of this region using brain stimulation techniques can interrupt both “outer” and inner speech.</h1><p></p><p>So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing. One worry, though, is whether the inner speech we get people to do in experiments is the same as our everyday experience of inner speech. As you might imagine, it’s quite hard to study inner speech in a controlled, scientific manner, because it is an inherently private act.</p><p></p><p>Typically, studies have required participants to repeat sentences to themselves in their heads, or, sometimes, count the syllables in words presented on a computer screen. These lack both the spontaneity of typical inner experiences and the conversational quality (think of the conversation with your boss) and motivational purposes (“Milk!”) of inner speech. Although the experience is undoubtedly different for everyone (not everyone reports having “conversations” in their head, for example), what does seem clear is that inner speech is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Why does it matter whether we have an accurate understanding of what’s going on in our brains when we use inner speech?</p><p></p><p>One reason is that understanding typical inner experience may be the key to understanding more unusual inner experiences. For example, psychologists have argued that <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/hearing-voices/#.U_SzYUix9FQ\">hearing voices</a> (“auditory verbal hallucinations”) might simply be a form of inner speech that has not been recognised as self-produced (although there are also important competing theories). Neuroscientists have found some evidence in favour of this theory. When they scanned the brains of people who reported hearing voices, they discovered that many of the same areas of the brain are active during both auditory hallucinations and inner speech. Broca’s area, for example, is often active in people when they’re hearing voices.</p><p></p><p>But if we really want to know what the <em>difference</em> between what happens in the brain during inner speech and voice hearing – and how inner speech might become hearing voices – then first we need to understand what our internal talk is usually like. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158212000125\">A recent study by researchers in Finland</a> attempted to address flaws in previous brain-imaging studies of inner speech. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), they studied the difference between activity in the brain when participants experienced an auditory verbal hallucination, and when they deliberately imagined hearing the same voice. In this way, they controlled for aspects of the experience such as the sound and the content of the voice.</p><p></p><p>They found the main difference between the two conditions was the level of activation in a cortical region known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supplementary_motor_area\">supplementary motor area (SMA)</a>, which contributes to the control of movement. When participants heard voices, there was significantly less activation in the SMA, which fits with previous hypotheses suggesting that recognizing actions as one’s own might rely on signals from motor cortical areas reaching sensory areas of the brain.</p><p></p><p>Of course, none of this is to say that understanding what happens in the brain is the only, or the most important, aspect of research into hearing voices. We also need to understand what the experience is like, how we can help people who are distressed by it, and when there’s a need for psychiatric care. But to do any of this, we first need to know what typical inner speech is like, and the underlying neuroscience is part of that understanding.</p></blockquote>")

# note7 = Note.create(user_id: 1, notebook_id: 3, title: "Why Dolphins are Deep Thinkers", body: "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science\">At a Marine Mammal Studies Institute, dolphins were trained to turn in trash that fell into the pools in exchange for fish.</a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/jul/03/research.science\">One dolphin was smart enough to hide pieces of paper under a rock, tearing off smaller pieces from the paper in order to get more fish out of it.</a></p><p></p><blockquote><p>At the Institute for Marine Mammal Studies in Mississippi, Kelly the dolphin has built up quite a reputation. All the dolphins at the institute are trained to hold onto any litter that falls into their pools until they see a trainer, when they can trade the litter for fish. In this way, the dolphins help to keep their pools clean.<br></p><p>Kelly has taken this task one step further. When people drop paper into the water she hides it under a rock at the bottom of the pool. The next time a trainer passes, she goes down to the rock and tears off a piece of paper to give to the trainer. After a fish reward, she goes back down, tears off another piece of paper, gets another fish, and so on. This behaviour is interesting because it shows that Kelly has a sense of the future and delays gratification. She has realised that a big piece of paper gets the same reward as a small piece and so delivers only small pieces to keep the extra food coming. She has, in effect, trained the humans.<br></p><p>Her cunning has not stopped there. One day, when a gull flew into her pool, she grabbed it, waited for the trainers and then gave it to them. It was a large bird and so the trainers gave her lots of fish. This seemed to give Kelly a new idea. The next time she was fed, instead of eating the last fish, she took it to the bottom of the pool and hid it under the rock where she had been hiding the paper. When no trainers were present, she brought the fish to the surface and used it to lure the gulls, which she would catch to get even more fish. After mastering this lucrative strategy, she taught her calf, who taught other calves, and so gull-baiting has become a hot game among the dolphins.<br></p><p>\"Intelligence\" is a term with many definitions and interpretations. It's difficult enough to measure in humans let alone other animals. Large brains are traditionally associated with greater intelligence, and the brain of the adult bottlenose dolphin is about 25% heavier than the average adult human brain. Generally though, larger mammals tend to have larger brains, and so a more accurate estimate of brain power comes from the ratio of brain size to body size - the \"encephalisation quotient\" (EQ). While river dolphins have an EQ of 1.5, some dolphins have EQs that are more than double those of our closest relatives: gorillas have 1.76, chimpanzees 2.48, bottlenose dolphins 5.6. The bottlenose's EQ is surpassed only by a human's, which measures 7.4 (Australopithecines - hominids that lived around 4m years ago - fall within the dolphin range: 3.25-4.72). But we don't know enough about the workings of the brain to be sure of what these anatomical measurements truly represent. Today, most scientists share the view that it is behaviour, not structure, that must be the measure of intelligence within a species.</p><p>Dolphins have invented a range of feeding strategies that more than match the diversity of habitats in which they live. In an estuary off the coast of Brazil, tucuxi dolphins are regularly seen capturing fish by \"tail whacking\". They flick a fish up to 9 metres with their tail flukes and then pick the stunned prey from the water surface. Peale's dolphins in the Straits of Magellan off Patagonia forage in kelp beds, use the seaweed to disguise their approach and cut off the fishes' escape route. In Galveston Bay, Texas, certain female bottlenose dolphins and their young follow shrimp boats. The dolphins swim into the shrimp nets to take live fish and then wriggle out again - a skill requiring expertise to avoid entanglement in the fishing nets.<br></p><p>Dolphins can also use tools to solve problems. Scientists have observed a dolphin coaxing a reluctant moray eel out of its crevice by killing a scorpion fish and using its spiny body to poke at the eel. Off the western coast of Australia, bottlenose dolphins place sponges over their snouts, which protects them from the spines of stonefish and stingrays as they forage over shallow seabeds.</p><p><br>A dolphin's ability to invent novel behaviours was put to the test in a famous experiment by the renowned dolphin expert Karen Pryor. Two rough-toothed dolphins were rewarded whenever they came up with a new behaviour. It took just a few trials for both dolphins to realise what was required. A similar trial was set up with humans. The humans took about as long to realise what they were being trained to do as did the dolphins. For both the dolphins and the humans, there was a period of frustration (even anger, in the humans) before they \"caught on\". Once they figured it out, the humans expressed great relief, whereas the dolphins raced around the tank excitedly, displaying more and more novel behaviours.<br></p><p>Dolphins are quick learners. Calves stay with their mothers for several years, allowing the time and opportunity for extensive learning to take place, particularly through imitation. At a dolphinarium, a person standing by the pool's window noticed that a dolphin calf was watching him. When he released a puff of smoke from his cigarette, the dolphin immediately swam off to her mother, returned and released a mouthful of milk, causing a similar effect to the cigarette smoke. Another dolphin mimicked the scraping of the pool's observation window by a diver, even copying the sound of the air-demand valve of the scuba gear while releasing a stream of bubbles from his blowhole.<br></p><p>Many species live in complex societies. To fit in, young dolphins must learn about the conventions and rules of dolphin society, teamwork and who's who in the group. For these dolphins, play provides an ideal opportunity to learn about relationships in a relatively non-threatening way. At Sarasota Bay in Florida, Randall Wells and his team have observed groups of juvenile male bottlenose dolphins behaving like boisterous teenage boys. Using its head to do the lifting, one dolphin may even get another dolphin air borne, actually tossing it out of the water. It's unclear exactly what is going on. It could be play, but more likely these are serious interactions that are defining social relationships.<br></p><p>Dolphins gradually build up a network of relationships, ranging from the strong bond between a mother and calf, to casual \"friendships\" with other community members. Wells and his team were the first to notice that adult male bottlenose dolphins tend to hang out in pairs. The dolphins' motivation for ganging together is under study but may involve ecological and/or reproductive benefits. Dolphins may also form \"supergangs\". Richard Connor and his team in Shark Bay, Western Australia, discovered a group of 14 males. The supergang was a force to be reckoned with. In the three years it was studied, it never lost a fight.<br></p><p>To keep track of the many different relationships within a large social group, it helps to have an efficient communication system. Dolphins use a variety of clicks and whistles to keep in touch. Some species have a signature whistle, which, like a name, is a unique sound that allows other dolphins to identify it. Dolphins also communicate using touch and body postures. By human definition, there is currently no evidence that dolphins have a language. But we've barely begun to record all their sounds and body signals let alone try to decipher them. At Kewalo Basin Marine Laboratory in Hawaii, Lou Herman and his team set about testing a dolphin's ability to comprehend our language. They developed a sign language to communicate with the dolphins, and the results were remarkable. Not only do the dolphins understand the meaning of individual words, they also understand the significance of word order in a sentence. (One of their star dolphins, Akeakamai, has learned a vocabulary of more than 60 words and can understand more than 2,000 sentences.) Particularly impressive is the dolphins' relaxed attitude when new sentences are introduced. For example, the dolphins generally responded correctly to \"touch the frisbee with your tail and then jump over it\". This has the characteristics of true understanding, not rigid training.<br></p><p>Lou Herman and Adam Pack taught the dolphins two further signals. One they called \"repeat\" and the other \"different\", which called for a change from the current behaviour. The dolphins responded correctly. Another test of awareness comes from mirror experiments. Diana Reiss and her researchers installed mirrors inside New York Aquarium to test whether two bottlenose dolphins were self-aware enough to recognise their reflections. They placed markings in non-toxic black ink on various places of the dolphins' bodies. The dolphins swam to the mirror and exposed the black mark to check it out. They spent more time in front of the mirror after being marked than when they were not marked. The ability to recognise themselves in the mirror suggests self-awareness, a quality previously only seen in people and great apes.<br></p><p>Not only do dolphins recognise their mirror images, but they can also watch TV. Language-trained chimps only learned to respond appropriately to TV screens after a long period of training. In contrast, Lou Herman's dolphins responded appropriately the very first time they were exposed to television.<br></p><p>Of course, an understanding of TV is of little use in the wild, but the ability to respond to new situations has huge implications. In the shallows of Florida Bay, Laura Engleby and her team have recently discovered an ingenious fishing strategy. A number of the local dolphin groups seem to use a circle of mud to catch mullet. The action usually begins with one dolphin swimming off in a burst of speed. It then dives below the surface, circling a shoal of fish, stirring up mud along the way. On cue, the other dolphins in the group move into position, forming a barrier to block off any underwater escape routes. As the circle of mud rises to the surface, the mullet are trapped. Their only option is to leap clear out of the water and unwittingly straight into the open mouths of the waiting dolphins.<br></p><p>There is still much to learn about these flexible problem-solvers, but from the evidence so far, it seems that dolphins do indeed deserve their reputation for being highly intelligent.</p></blockquote>" )

In the first year of selling the product, restaurant sales more than tripled, with 75% of the increase coming from sales of fried chicken. For Harman, the addition of fried chicken was a way of differentiating his restaurant from competitors; in Utah, a product hailing from Kentucky was unique and evoked imagery of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_hospitality\" title=\"Southern hospitality\">Southern hospitality</a>. Don Anderson, a sign painter hired by Harman, coined the name <em>Kentucky Fried Chicken</em>. After Harman's success, several other restaurant owners franchised the concept and paid Sanders $0.04 per chicken.</p><p></p><p>Sanders believed that his North Corbin restaurant would remain successful indefinitely, but at age 65 sold it after the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_75\" title=\"Interstate 75\">Interstate 75</a> reduced customer traffic. Left only with his savings and $105 a month from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)\" title=\"Social Security (United States)\">Social Security</a>, Sanders decided to begin to franchise his chicken concept in earnest, and traveled the US looking for suitable restaurants. After closing the North Corbin site, Sanders and Claudia opened a new restaurant and company headquarters in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelbyville,_Kentucky\" title=\"Shelbyville, Kentucky\">Shelbyville</a> in 1959. Often sleeping in the back of his car, Sanders visited restaurants, offered to cook his chicken, and if workers liked it negotiated franchise rights.</p><p></p><p>Although such visits required much time, eventually potential franchisees began visiting Sanders instead. He ran the company while Claudia mixed and shipped the spices to restaurants. The franchise approach became highly successful; KFC was one of the first fast food chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in Canada and later in England, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. </p><p></p><p>The company's rapid expansion to more than 600 locations became overwhelming for the aging Sanders. In 1964, he sold the Kentucky Fried Chicken corporation for $2 million to a partnership of Kentucky businessmen headed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Y._Brown,_Jr.\" title=\"John Y. Brown, Jr.\">John Y. Brown, Jr.</a> (a then-29-year-old lawyer and future governor of Kentucky) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_C._Massey\" title=\"Jack C. Massey\">Jack C. Massey</a> (a venture capitalist and entrepreneur), and he became a salaried brand ambassador. The initial deal did not include the Canadian operations (which Sanders retained) or the franchising rights in England, Florida, Utah, and Montana (which Sanders had already sold to others).</p><p></p><p>In 1965, Sanders moved to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississauga\" title=\"Mississauga\">Mississauga</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario\" title=\"Ontario\">Ontario</a> to oversee his Canadian franchises and continued to collect franchise and appearance fees both in Canada and in the U.S. Sanders bought and lived in a bungalow at 1337 Melton Drive in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lakeview,_Mississauga\" title=\"Lakeview, Mississauga\">Lakeview</a> area of Mississauga from 1965 to 1980.

He also befriended <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Graham\" title=\"Billy Graham\">Billy Graham</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerry_Falwell\" title=\"Jerry Falwell\">Jerry Falwell</a>.</p><p></p><p>Sanders remained the company's symbol after selling it, traveling 200,000 miles a year on the company's behalf and filming many TV commercials and appearances. He retained much influence over executives and franchisees, who respected his culinary expertise and feared what <em>The New Yorker</em> described as \"the force and variety of his swearing\" when a restaurant or the company varied from what executives described as \"the <em>Colonel's</em> chicken\". One change the company made was to the gravy, which Sanders had bragged was so good that \"it'll make you throw away the durn chicken and just eat the gravy\" but which the company simplified to reduce time and cost. As late as 1979 Sanders made surprise visits to KFC restaurants, and if the food disappointed him denounced it to the franchisee as \"God-damned slop\" or pushed it onto the floor. In 1973, Sanders sued <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heublein_Inc.\" title=\"Heublein Inc.\">Heublein Inc.</a>—the then parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken—over the alleged misuse of his image in promoting products he had not helped develop. In 1975, Heublein Inc. unsuccessfully sued Sanders for libel after he publicly described their gravy as \"wallpaper paste\" to which \"sludge\" was added.</p><p></p><p>Sanders and his wife reopened their Shelbyville restaurant as \"Claudia Sanders, The Colonel's Lady\" and served KFC-style chicken there as part of a full-service dinner menu, and talked about expanding the restaurant into a chain.

It has been the pinnacle of motoring for the last six years. Many facts have famously been splashed around about the Veyron, things like “At 250 mph, the Veyron’s tires will last fifteen minutes. Its 26.4-gallon fuel tank goes dry in twelve.” And “At the Veyron’s 253-mph top speed, the Veyron consumes 47,000 litres of air per minute — as much air as one man breathes in four days.”</p><p></p><p>You can pick these 95 RON facts up on some repeat on Dave but here are some Ultimate Unleaded 102 RON pub ammo facts about the Bugatti Veyron.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 1: </strong>The waste energy from running the 16.4 litre engine at full whack could heat 10 family homes in the winter.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 2: </strong>It takes 15 hours to build one radiator for the Veyron – each car has a total of 10.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 3: </strong>The brakes can withstand heat of up to 1800°C</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 4: </strong>When the air brake is at an angle of 55 degrees it generates 70% of the braking force of an average car.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 5: </strong>The Bugatti Veyron is split into three parts and only held together with 14 bolts.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 6: </strong>The Veyron uses special Michelin PAX tires found on no other car. The rear wheels are 14.5 inches wide, twice as wide as a normal car. If you require replacements the car needs to be shipped to France, a process that costs $70,000.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 7: </strong>It takes 8 days to weld a Bugatti Veyron fuel tank.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 8: </strong>In a Veyron it is quicker to decelerate from 60mph to 0 than it is to accelerate there. (It only takes 2.8 seconds to get to 60)</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 9: </strong>Once being road tested for 500 kilometres, each car is put in a light tunnel and inspected and polished for two days solid.</p><p></p><p><strong>Fact 10: </strong>A Bugatti Veyron uses fuel pumps that can pump fuel eight times faster than a normal car.</p></blockquote>")

The website looks identical to BestBuy.com…except for the prices.</p><p></p><p>The secret website was first revealed by George Gombossy of the Hartford Courant (Way to go, George!). While investigating a tip from a reader, George was shown the internal website. It was identical to BestBuy.com, but showed a higher price for the item he was interested in. George was mislead by Best Buy employees to believe it was the “real” BestBuy.com. Eventually he found some Best Buy employees who admitted to the site’s existence and even showed him how it worked.</p><p></p><p>Now, after initially denying the site existed, Best Buy is cooperating with the investigation. From George’s column:</p><blockquote><p><em>Company spokesman Justin Barber, who in early February denied the existence of the internal website that could be accessed only by employees, says his company is “cooperating fully” with the state attorney general’s investigation.</em></p><p><em>Barber insists that the company never intended to mislead customers.</em></p><p><em>State Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered the investigation into Best Buy’s practices on Feb. 9 after my column disclosed the website and showed how employees at two Connecticut stores used it to deny customers a $150 discount on a computer advertised on BestBuy.com.</em></p><p><em>Blumenthal said Wednesday that Best Buy has also confirmed to his office the existence of the intranet site, but has so far failed to give clear answers about its purpose and use.</em></p><p><em>“Their responses seem to raise as many questions as they answer,” Blumenthal said in a telephone interview. “Their answers are less than crystal clear.”</em></p></blockquote><p>There was a lot of speculation as to whether this “secret intranet” was real or not. It’s real. Was it designed and built with the specific intention of misleading customers? We shall see.</p></blockquote>")
